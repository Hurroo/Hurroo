### Hullo


The ever enjoyable about me. Lets see...

I'm newer to programming. Prior to this I was doing field biology.

I'm currently working on a website to act as a type of portfolio where I can showcase completed projects/applications as well as just use it as a playground for whatever I want to learn.

Currently I have a few projects planned that I'm going to use to learn more about databases, React, REST systems, webhooks, playing around with user input and user accounts. I've also been working on a Discord bot for my FFXIV free company's discord server to teach myself/get more practice with JavaScript. Currently, all I have is formatting to organize different resources and guides to make them more accessible.

On the more personal side, I enjoy playing video games. Zelda and Final Fantasy are my two favorite franchises.
